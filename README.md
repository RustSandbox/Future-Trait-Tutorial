# Run tests for working examples
cargo test --bin basic_future
cargo test --bin custom_delay
cargo test --bin error_handling
```

## üìö Tutorial Structure

### 1. Basic Future Concepts
**File**: `src/examples/basic_future.rs`
**Run**: `cargo run --bin basic_future`

Learn the fundamentals of async/await in Rust:
- Understanding future laziness
- Sequential vs concurrent execution
- Basic error handling in async functions
- Working with async closures

**Key Concepts Covered**:
- `async fn` and `async {}` blocks
- `.await` syntax and when to use it
- `tokio::join!` for concurrent execution
- Performance benefits of async programming

### 2. Custom Future Implementation
**File**: `src/examples/custom_delay.rs`
**Run**: `cargo run --bin custom_delay`

Deep dive into implementing the Future trait manually:
- Understanding `Poll::Ready` vs `Poll::Pending`
- Working with `Waker` for efficient scheduling
- Managing shared state between threads
- Proper resource cleanup and cancellation safety

**Key Concepts Covered**:
- `Future` trait implementation
- `Pin<&mut Self>` and memory safety
- `Context` and `Waker` mechanics
- State machine patterns

### 3. Error Handling Patterns
**File**: `src/examples/error_handling.rs`
**Run**: `cargo run --bin error_handling`

Comprehensive error handling in async Rust:
- Custom error types with `thiserror`
- Error propagation with `?` operator
- Timeout handling and retry logic
- Concurrent error handling strategies
- Error recovery and resilience patterns

**Key Concepts Covered**:
- `Result<T, E>` with async functions
- `anyhow` for error context
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Graceful degradation

### 4. Future Combinators (Partial Implementation)
**File**: `src/examples/combinators.rs`
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Has compilation issues, but demonstrates concepts

Learn about composing futures with combinators:
- `map()` and `and_then()` for transformation
- `join!()` and `try_join!()` for concurrent execution
- `select!()` for racing futures
- Custom combinator implementation

**Note**: This example has some type inference issues but the concepts are well documented.

### 5. Autonomous Agent State Machine
**File**: `src/examples/autonomous_agent.rs`
**Run**: `cargo run --bin autonomous_agent`

Advanced example showing complex async state machines:
- Enum-based state machine implementation
- Integration with external APIs (simulated LLM)
- Channel-based communication patterns
- Background task coordination
- Error handling in stateful async operations
- Cancellation safety and timeout handling

**Key Concepts Covered**:
- Complex Future state machines
- `oneshot` channels for async communication
- Background task spawning and coordination
- Advanced polling patterns
- Real-world async system architecture

## üß™ Testing

Each working example includes comprehensive tests:

```bash
# Test basic future concepts
cargo test --bin basic_future

# Test custom future implementation
cargo test --bin custom_delay

# Test error handling patterns

## üö® Known Issues

### Combinators Example
The `combinators.rs` example has some type inference issues with `FuturesUnordered` and `tokio::join!`. The concepts are well documented, but the code needs refinement for compilation.

### Real-World Example
The `real_world.rs` example has similar type issues with concurrent HTTP requests. The patterns shown are correct but need type annotations for compilation.
