/// # Struct: SharedState
///
/// This struct represents the shared state between the Future and the
/// background thread that performs the actual timing work. It demonstrates
/// how to safely share mutable state across thread boundaries.
///
/// ## Fields:
/// - `completed`: Boolean flag indicating if the delay has finished
/// - `waker`: Optional Waker that the background thread uses to notify
///   the executor when the delay completes
///
/// ## Thread Safety:
/// - Wrapped in Arc<Mutex<_>> for safe sharing between threads
/// - The Mutex ensures only one thread can modify the state at a time
/// - Arc provides shared ownership across multiple threads
#[derive(Debug)]
struct SharedState {
    /// Indicates whether the delay operation has completed
    /// When true, the Future should return Poll::Ready

/// # Struct: DelayFuture
///
/// A custom Future implementation that completes after a specified duration.
/// This demonstrates the fundamental pattern for implementing custom futures:
///
/// 1. Store shared state that can be accessed by both the Future and external code
/// 2. Implement the Future trait with proper poll() logic
/// 3. Handle waker registration for efficient scheduling
///
/// ## Key Design Principles:
/// - **Lazy Execution**: Work only starts when the future is first polled
/// - **Cancellation Safe**: Can be dropped at any time without resource leaks
/// - **Efficient Scheduling**: Uses Waker to avoid busy-waiting
///
/// ## Fields:
/// - `shared_state`: Arc<Mutex<SharedState>> for thread-safe state sharing
/// - `duration`: The delay duration (stored for debugging/inspection)

    /// principle of "lazy futures," the actual work (spawning the timer thread)
    /// only begins when the future is first polled.
    ///
    /// ## Arguments:
    /// - `duration`: How long to delay before completing
    ///
    /// ## Returns:
    /// - A new DelayFuture instance ready to be polled
    ///
    /// ## Example:
    /// ```rust
    /// let delay = DelayFuture::new(Duration::from_millis(100));
    /// // No work has started yet - the future is lazy!
    /// let result = delay.await; // Now the work begins

    /// ## Key Implementation Details:
    /// - Spawns a new thread to perform the blocking sleep
    /// - The thread sleeps for the specified duration
    /// - When the sleep completes, it updates the shared state
    /// - If a waker was registered, it calls wake() to notify the executor
    ///

    /// - Uses Arc::clone to share ownership of the state with the thread
    /// - The spawned thread takes ownership of its Arc clone
    /// - Mutex ensures safe concurrent access to the shared state

/// # Implementation: Future for DelayFuture
///
/// This is the core implementation of the Future trait for our custom DelayFuture.

///
/// ## Key Concepts Demonstrated:
/// 1. **State Checking**: First check if work is already complete
/// 2. **Lazy Initialization**: Start work only on first poll
/// 3. **Waker Registration**: Store the waker for later notification
/// 4. **Proper Return Values**: Return Ready when done, Pending when waiting

    /// This is the heart of the Future trait. The executor calls this method

    /// ## Poll Implementation Pattern:
    /// 1. Check if the work is already complete â†’ return Poll::Ready
    /// 2. If not complete, ensure background work has started
    /// 3. Register the current task's waker for later notification
    /// 4. Return Poll::Pending to indicate more work is needed
    ///
    /// ## Arguments:
    /// - `self`: Pin<&mut Self> - ensures the future won't move in memory
    /// - `cx`: &mut Context - provides access to the current task's waker
    ///
    /// ## Returns:
    /// - Poll::Ready(String) when the delay has completed
    /// - Poll::Pending when still waiting for the delay to finish
    ///
    /// ## Memory Safety:
    /// The Pin<&mut Self> parameter ensures that once this future is polled,
    /// it won't be moved in memory. This is crucial for futures that might
    /// contain self-references in their generated state machines.

        // thread how to notify the executor when the delay completes
