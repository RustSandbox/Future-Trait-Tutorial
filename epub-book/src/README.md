# The Complete Future Trait Guide

This directory contains the source for "The Complete Future Trait Guide: Mastering Async Programming in Rust" - a comprehensive markdown book about implementing and understanding the Future trait in Rust.

## Building the Book

### Prerequisites

Install mdBook:

```bash
cargo install mdbook
```

### Building

From the project root directory:

```bash
# Build the book
mdbook build

# Serve the book locally with live reload
mdbook serve

# Open the book in your browser
mdbook serve --open
```

The built book will be available in the `book/` directory and served at `http://localhost:3000` when using `mdbook serve`.

## Book Structure

The book is organized into four main parts:

### Part I: Fundamentals
- **Chapter 1**: Understanding Async Programming
- **Chapter 2**: The Future Trait
- **Chapter 3**: Basic async/await

### Part II: Implementation
- **Chapter 4**: Custom Future Implementation
- **Chapter 5**: State Machines and Polling
- **Chapter 6**: Pin and Memory Safety

### Part III: Composition and Patterns
- **Chapter 7**: Future Combinators
- **Chapter 8**: Error Handling
- **Chapter 9**: Concurrent Patterns

### Part IV: Advanced Topics
- **Chapter 10**: Autonomous Agent Example
- **Chapter 11**: Real-World Applications
- **Chapter 12**: Performance and Best Practices

### Appendices
- **Appendix A**: Code Examples
- **Appendix B**: Testing Strategies
- **Appendix C**: Common Pitfalls
- **Appendix D**: Resources

## Code Examples

All code examples in the book are fully tested and can be found in the `src/examples/` directory:

```bash
# Run basic async/await examples
cargo run --bin basic_future

# Run custom Future implementation examples
cargo run --bin custom_delay

# Run error handling examples
cargo run --bin error_handling

# Run autonomous agent example
cargo run --bin autonomous_agent
```

## Testing Examples

Each example comes with comprehensive tests:

```bash
# Test all examples
cargo test

# Test specific examples
cargo test --bin basic_future
cargo test --bin custom_delay
cargo test --bin error_handling
cargo test --bin autonomous_agent
```
